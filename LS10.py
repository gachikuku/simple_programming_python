"""
Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements, e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] â†’ [a,1,b,2,c,3].

#Using numpy but outputs have '' around numbers
#import numpy as np
#alternate_list = np.array([[i,j] for i, j in zip(letters, numbers)]).ravel()


#This is called list comprehension using zip(can take more than 2 args) function.
